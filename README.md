## About Me

Systems-focused C++/C# developer and game programming student at Forsbergs Skola.  
25+ years of prior experience as a network engineer (EA, USAF, financial and telecom sectors).

I enjoy building small, robust systems: algorithms/data structures, gameplay frameworks, and tools.

## Selected projects

Coming soon: curated C++ algorithms repo, Unity tools framework, and a deckbuilding engine prototype.
